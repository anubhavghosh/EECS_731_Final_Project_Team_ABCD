# Final Project of Team ABCD for EECS 731(Introduction to Data Science) at the University of Kansas
This repository contains the restaurant recommendation project that has been created on the dataset collected from Zomato.

# What is covered in this project?
The work covers four distinctive elements of data analytics and data science. They are as follows:
1. Anomaly Detection in the dataset. 
2. Classification models on the dataset for the prediction of the ratings that a restaurant can receive, using various supervised models
3. Content-Based Recommendation (B2C Application) system for the users which can recommend a restaurant which offers a set of restaurants which you have just visited
4. Clustering (B2B) application which clusters restaurants which are very similar to each other so that a business can analyse who are its competitors. This can play a pivotal role in decision making for mergers and acquisitions.

# Report on Clustering
A- The clusterings that have been done for this data set are 2, 3, 4 and 5 clusterings. The data is actually 5 dimensional data. After performing Principal component analysis, it projects the data on the two dimensions which explain the variability the most. The variability percentage is shown in the presentation.

B- I have also experimented a bit with regression models to fit into the data. I have plotted few plotted showing correlation with some important features. The C_p test is conducted to figure out the most important parameters in the data. The regression was not showing much strong result which was also apparent from the plot as the line was missing many of the data points. But being one of the simplest models to try that has high potential to explain the causation, it was worth trying.
