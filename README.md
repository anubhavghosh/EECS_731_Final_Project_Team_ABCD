# Final Project of Team ABCD for EECS 731(Introduction to Data Science) at the University of Kansas
This repository contains the restaurant recommendation project that has been created on the dataset collected from Zomato.

# What is covered in this project?
The work covers four distinctive elements of data analytics and data science. They are as follows:
1. Anomaly Detection in the dataset. 
2. Classification models on the dataset for the prediction of the ratings that a restaurant can receive, using various supervised models
3. Content-Based Recommendation (B2C Application) system for the users which can recommend a restaurant which offers a set of restaurants which you have just visited
4. Clustering (B2B) application which clusters restaurants which are very similar to each other so that a business can analyse who are its competitors. This can play a pivotal role in decision making for mergers and acquisitions.
